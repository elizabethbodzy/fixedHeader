            <p class="description bold"> No matter how great you read on paper, ultimately itâ€™s the impression made during an interview that closes the deal! A successful interview enables you to shine by providing the opportunity to expand on the points highlighted in your resume and to express your passion, personality and accomplishments.  Successful interviewing takes practice, confidence and feedback. </p>
