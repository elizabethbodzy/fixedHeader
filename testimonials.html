            <p class="testimonial extra-padding"> I had a great experience working with Mary Lee.  She was extremely helpful and provided valuable insight in updating and tailoring my resume for the specific legal job position for which I was applying.  She was professional, courteous, and thorough. She's also incredibly sweet and a pleasure to work with.  I will definitely seek her services again! <br> <br>–Legal Associate </p>

            <p class="testimonial testimonial-2"> Mary Lee was an amazing person to work with while trying to format a resume and cover letter. She asked me detailed questions and grew to understand what my needs were for a job. It reflected perfectly in the resume and cover letter. The first time I sent it out, I immediately got an interview! I could not have asked to work with a better person; she is knowledgable and resourceful! Thank you Mary Lee!

            <p class="testimonial testimonial-2"> Several years ago when I was in the process of transitioning my career I asked several friends if they knew anyone who could be of assistance. Several told me about Mary Lee Broder. I met with her and had an instant connection.  Mary Lee took my past experience and made it come alive on paper. This would not have been possible had she not met with me and gotten to know me.  Both of my daughters have had Mary Lee help them entering their careers and we have referred friends. You can’t go wrong with Mary Lee.

            <p class="testimonial"> I'm a freelance television producer with more than 15 years of experience. Needless to say I have had countless jobs over the years. And I was in desperate need of help updating and organizing my lengthy employment history. That's when I found Mary Lee! She listened while I explained my what my goals were and helped me create a format and strategy to best achieve that. She devised a way to organize the information in an easy to read manner with emphasis on eye catching industry key words and phrases. We worked together, but her experience and expertise were apparent from the start. When we finished, I felt a renewed sense of pride in myself and in the image I was portraying through my resume. Since my resume revamp with Mary Lee I have been hired for numerous projects. And just the other day I received an email back from an application I submitted that said, "Impressive resume." I think the results speak for themselves! </p>

            <p class="testimonial adjust-space"> I consider Mary Lee Broder's counsel on my first professional resume and interviewing process as the launchpad of my career. Not only did she guide me on structure, presentation and continuity, but more importantly she helped me frame my experience in a way that made it applicable and valuable to the job I was pursuing. This was no small feat considering my aforementioned experience consisted mainly of babysitting and volunteering, and I was aiming high for jobs in fashion and PR in New York City. Mary Lee, though, identified in my seemingly menial experience a common thread of discipline, perseverance, and willingness to work hard from the ground up. Carrying this insight into interviews, I was exponentially more confident after working with her; I had found a way to present myself that felt genuine and valuable - and it still serves me today. <br> <br>

            Mary Lee does not just help polish your resume and presentation skills; she sees your individual strengths and helps you harness them into your professional goals. It's a testament to the personal investment she puts in her clients. After equipping me with the tools I needed to succeed in the interviewing process, Mary Lee also helped me navigate a new and intimidating industry through her own relationships and understanding of the field. To this day, I have her 'personal touch' to thank for some of the most important opportunities and advancements in my career. She has an unmatched level of experience, a vast network and a professional wherewithal that make her an invaluable guide to someone looking to pave a career with purpose and success. <br> <br>–Public Relations Professional
