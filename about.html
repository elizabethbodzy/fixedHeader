			<img class="about-img" src="assets/marylee.png"> 

			<p class="about"> I’m a marketer at heart!  After a successful career in advertising and marketing strategy, I found my passion in helping people to effectively market themselves.  For 15 years, IdentityLink has helped students, recent graduates, and professionals present themselves in the best possible light to academic institutions and to potential employers.
			</p>

			<p class="about">I began my career at Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising in 1985, working with clients including L’Eggs pantyhose, Life Savers, and Northwest Airlines.  Following a move to Dallas in 1990, I developed promotions for Embassy Suites Hotels and later worked as a freelance marketing consultant.  I began to transition from helping businesses into helping individuals develop a meaningful point of difference for their brand and realized that it is much more fun and rewarding to market people versus products.  I bring this same passion to my volunteer and philanthropic work.  I am a past chair of the UPenn Parents Council and currently serve on the Executive Committee for the Vogel Alcove. </p>

			<p class="about"> I received my BA in Psychology from Emory University and my MBA in Marketing and Finance from Northwestern University’s Kellogg Graduate School of Management.  My husband, Michael, and I are the proud parents of two children, Katie and Brian, both recent graduates of the University of Pennsylvania.  Through my own children I experienced private schools, the college admissions process and their first job search.  I survived and they thrived, so I bring a personal understanding to the essay, resume and interview process. </p>
